            <p>Fauna is all of the animal life present in a particular region or time. The corresponding terms for plants
                and fungi are flora and funga, respectively. Flora, fauna, funga and other forms of life are collectively
                referred to as biota. Zoologists and paleontologists use fauna to refer to a typical collection of animals
                found in a specific time or place, e.g. the "Sonoran Desert fauna" or the "Burgess Shale fauna".
                Paleontologists sometimes refer to a sequence of faunal stages, which is a series of rocks all containing
                similar fossils. The study of animals of a particular region is called faunistics.</p>

        <h2>Habitate</h2>
        <div class="imgtc">
            <p>In ecology, habitat refers to the array of resources, biotic factors that are present in an area, such as to
                support the survival and reproduction of a particular species. A species habitat can be seen as the physical
                manifestation of its ecological niche. Thus „habitat” is a species-specific term, fundamentally different
                from concepts such as environment or vegetation assemblages, for which the term „habitat-type” is more
                appropriate.</p>

            <p>The physical factors may include (for example): soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity.
                Biotic factors include the availability of food and the presence or absence of predators. Every species has
                particular habitat requirements, habitat generalist species are able to thrive in a wide array of
                environmental conditions while habitat specialist species require a very limited set of factors to survive.
                The habitat of a species is not necessarily found in a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem,
                a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss; a parasitic organism has as its habitat the body of its host, part
                of the host's body (such as the digestive tract), or a single cell within the host's body.</p>
            <p>Habitat types are environmental categorizations of different environments based on the characteristics of a
                given geographical area, particularly vegetation and climate. Thus habitat types do not refer to a single
                species but to multiple species living in the same area. For example, terrestrial habitat types include
                forest, steppe, grassland, semi-arid or desert. Fresh-water habitat types include marshes, streams, rivers,
                lakes, and ponds; marine habitat types include salt marshes, the coast, the intertidal zone, estuaries,
                reefs, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and submarine vents.</p>
            <p>Habitat types may change over time. Causes of change may include a violent event (such as the eruption of a
                volcano, an earthquake, a tsunami, a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents); or change may occur more
                gradually over millennia with alterations in the climate, as ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat,
                and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation. Other changes come as
                a direct result of human activities, such as deforestation, the plowing of ancient grasslands, the diversion
                and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. The introduction of alien
                species can have a devastating effect on native wildlife - through increased predation, through competition
                for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the indigenous species have no
                immunity.</p>
